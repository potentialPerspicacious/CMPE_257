In this problem we will be using the MNIST dataset and Load the first 10K samples from “train.scv” and split them into training and testing data by 0.2. Use sklearn.svm to train a model with raw pixel features. Choose the linear kernel and set  C = 5 and γ = 0.05 and Report the model.
List the support vectors for each class and test the prediction accuracy by metrics.classification report.
Run with RBF kernel and the same C and γ.
Compare the two models
