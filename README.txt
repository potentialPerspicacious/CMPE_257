 In this problem, we will build a D-tree based on the data given:
 
                          Table shows some samples of debt evading history.

Tasks:
1. Process the data to make it available for a tree classifier.
2. Train a D-tree and generate a figure of the D-tree with graphviz.

Solution:
***Run the data_debtevasion.py to create a .csv file which replicates the above given data table***
***Run the debt_evasion.py to generate the DT model and figure of the D-Tree using graphviz***
