1. generate a data set and cluster it with K-Means clustering algorithm.
(a) Import sklearn.datasets.make blobs and generate a shuffled data set with: 
    1. 2000 Samples
    2. 2 features
    3. 5 centers
    4. Cluster standard deviation 0.8
(b) Run K-Means algorithm on the generated data set with 5 initial cluster centers. Use the default settings for other values. List the centers of each blob and plot the clustered data with centers marked.

2. Do with 10 initial cluster centers

3. Add 10% random noise to the samples
