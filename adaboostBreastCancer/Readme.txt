1. Build an Adaboost classifier to classify breast cancer and compare the results with the decision tree classifier.
Load the breast cancer data set and split it into training and testing sets with 5 : 1 ratio.

2. Build a decision tree classifier with max depth of 3. Train the model using the training data set and test the accuracy of the model.

3. Build an Adaboost classifier. Set the maximum depth of the base D-Tree estimator to 3 and maximum number of estimators to 50. Compare the accuracy

4. Increase the maximum number of estimators of the Adaboost model from 50 to 500 with step size 50. Compare the accuracy of the resulting models and comment on the observations.
