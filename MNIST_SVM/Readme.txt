1. In this problem we will use the MNIST dataset to load the first 10K samples from “train.scv” and split them into training and testing data by 0.2. and train a model with raw pixel features by Choosing the linear kernel and set C = 5 and γ = 0.05

2. List the support vectors for each class and test the prediction accuracy

3. Use RBF kernel for the same C and γ and compare the results.
