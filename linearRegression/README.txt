Boston housing dataset is a famous dataset widely used for machine learning.  
we will train a linear regeression model that predicts the house price using the Boston housing dataset.

Tasks:

1. Load Boston house prices dataset.
   Store all the features and targets into X and Y respectively. 
   Split the data into 80% training set and 20% test set.
   
2. Train a linear regression model using all the features.

3. Test the model using the test set.
   Find mean squared error and r2score between the predicting result and target.
