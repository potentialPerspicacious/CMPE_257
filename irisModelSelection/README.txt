Model selection plays an important role in machine learning. Objective to use it and optimize the learning process

Tasks:
1. Load the Iris data set.

2. List target_names and feature_names of Iris. Plot the data based on the any two selected features.

3. Select a target name intargetnames. Generate the target (label) Y by setting the label of samples 
   with selected target name to 1 and the labels of the remaining samples to 0.
   
4. Split your data to 80% training data and 20% test data. Build a Logistic Regression model and train 
   with the training data set. Test your trained model on the test data set find the estimated probabilities 
   of the samples in the test data set.
   
5. Use k-fold and stratified k-fold for the model selection. Use both functions to split the training data to 4 folds.

6. Generate the cross validation score by 4 folds with the Logistic Regression model.
